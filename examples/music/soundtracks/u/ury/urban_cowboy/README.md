# Import Notes

## Urban Cowboy (CD)

* Source data from ID3 metadata
    * Pretty accurate data

## Urban Cowboy (Vinyl)

* Same song data
    * Song order is actually the same
    * Shouldn't be a surprise, CDs have long length

* Record "side" order is weird
    * First record has sides A and D
    * Second record has sides B and C
    * Weirdly this is MORE efficient

* Change/flip order with a 2 record album
    * Record 1, sides A & B, Record 2, sides C & D
        * Change, Flip, Change, Flip
    * Record 1, sides A & D, Record 2, sides B & C
        * Change, Change, Flip, Change

## Urban Cowboy II

* Source data from album
    * Very little information about this album online
    * Composer values was first initial, last name
    * Will need to do more googling to get it complete
* Source info articles
